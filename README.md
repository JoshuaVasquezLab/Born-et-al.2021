Mycobacterium tuberculosis precursor rRNA indicates treatment-shortening activity of drugs and regimens, Walter et al. 2021

R script and datasets of single-bacillary quantitative image analysis of multiplexed in situ hybridization (ISH) of rRNA species in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in lung granulomas from C3HeB/FeJ mice. Granulomas were stained by fluorescent ISH for Mtb 23S rRNA and pre-rRNA, and counterstained with DAPI. R script on analysis of granuloma using kruskal-wallis test for mean fluorescent intensity values from RNA Scope Assay (Figure 2e). Datasets are available as *csv. Observations from analysis of these data have been submitted for review to Nature Communications as figures 2b, 2e and extended figure 2, 3b and 3c from the manuscript entitled "Mycobacterium tuberculosis precursor rRNA indicates treatment-shortening activity of drugs and regimens".
